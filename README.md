# text_prediction_application
A text prediction application for movie reviews with sentiment analysis in real time


### Notes
* This project is inspired by Kevin Markham from Data School [https://www.dataschool.io/about/]
* An adaptive version of the application is going to be built based on the concept of this application [https://justmarkham.shinyapps.io/textprediction/] 
* The goal for this application is to predict the sentimnet level (postive or negative) of a movie review in real-time with the ability to recommend the next word that a user is going to type

### How To Build
* The movie review dataset is going to be used to build models for prediction.
